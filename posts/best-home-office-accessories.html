        <p>Working from home is great until you realize your "desk" is the kitchen table and your "office chair" is slowly destroying your back. Whether you're full-time remote or hybrid, these upgrades will make your home office actually feel like a place where you can get things done.</p>

        <h3>1. Logitech MX Master 3S Mouse — ~$90</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>👆 Best Upgrade Overall</h4>
            <p>Yes, it's pricier than the other picks on this list, but hear us out. This mouse has an electromagnetic scroll wheel that's insanely smooth, ergonomic shape that fits your hand perfectly, and it connects to three devices at once. If you spend 8+ hours a day on a computer, this is the single best quality-of-life upgrade you can make.</p>

        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>☕ Luxury Pick</h4>
            <p>Okay this is a splurge, but if you're the person who makes coffee and then forgets about it until it's cold — this mug keeps your drink at your exact preferred temperature for hours. It charges on a coaster and pairs with your phone. Is it ridiculous? A little. Does it make every morning better? Absolutely.</p>

        <h3>7. Autonomous ErgoFoam Footrest — ~$30</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <p>Most people ignore what's happening under the desk, but a footrest makes a massive difference for posture and circulation. This one has two height options, memory foam that doesn't flatten, and a non-slip bottom. Use it for a week and you'll never go back to dangling feet.</p>
