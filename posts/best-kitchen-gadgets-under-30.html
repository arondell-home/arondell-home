        <p>We've all bought that weird kitchen gadget that seemed genius at 2 AM and then sat in the back of the drawer forever. These are NOT those. These are the tools we reach for every single day — and they're all under $30.</p>

        <h3>1. OXO Good Grips Garlic Press — ~$16</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>🧄 Daily Driver</h4>
            <p>If you cook with garlic (and you should), stop mincing by hand. This OXO press handles unpeeled cloves, has big comfortable handles, and the built-in cleaner pops out the leftover bits. It cuts garlic prep from 2 minutes to 5 seconds. That adds up.</p>

        <h3>2. Thermapen ONE Instant-Read Thermometer — ~$30</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>🔥 Game Changer</h4>
            <p>Okay, this one pushes the $30 limit but it's the single best upgrade you can make in the kitchen. It reads temperature in ONE second. No more cutting into your steak to check if it's done. No more dry chicken. No more guessing. Once you have a good thermometer, you'll wonder how you ever cooked without one.</p>

        <h3>3. Lodge Cast Iron Skillet (10.25 inch) — ~$20</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <p>Your great-grandmother had one and there's a reason it lasted 80 years. A Lodge cast iron skillet sears meat better than any non-stick pan, goes from stovetop to oven, and literally gets better with age. This is the pan you'll hand down to your kids. Twenty bucks. Seriously.</p>

        <h3>4. Microplane Classic Zester — ~$15</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <p>This tiny tool punches way above its weight. Zest a lemon in 10 seconds, grate parmesan into fluffy snow, mince ginger without the stringy bits. Every professional chef has one. It's one of those things where you wonder what you've been doing your whole life without it.</p>

        <h3>5. Joseph Joseph Nest Measuring Cups — ~$13</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <p>These magnetic nesting cups snap together so they don't get scattered all over your drawer. They're color-coded, have both metric and imperial measurements, and the design is just satisfying to look at. It's the little things that make a kitchen feel organized.</p>

        <h3>6. OXO Good Grips Silicone Spatula Set — ~$12</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <p>A good spatula set is the backbone of any kitchen. These are heat-resistant to 600°F, won't scratch your non-stick pans, and the heads are actually shaped in a way that gets into corners. The small one is perfect for getting every last bit out of a jar. We're talking peanut butter, mayo, Nutella — nothing goes to waste.</p>

        <h3>7. Zulay Milk Frother — ~$10</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <p>Turn your boring morning coffee into a café latte for ten bucks. This little handheld frother runs on batteries and froths milk in about 15 seconds. It also works for matcha, protein shakes, and hot chocolate. It won't replace a $300 espresso machine, but honestly? It gets you 80% there.</p>
