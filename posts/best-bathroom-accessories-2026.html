        <p>Your bathroom doesn't have to be boring. Whether you're working with a tiny apartment bathroom or a full master suite, the right accessories can make it feel like a spa. Here are 10 affordable upgrades that punch way above their price point.</p>

        <h3>1. Bamboo Bath Mat — Eco-Friendly Pick</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>⭐ Eco-Friendly Pick</h4>
            <p>Step out of the shower onto natural bamboo instead of a soggy fabric mat. These mats are naturally water-resistant, mold-resistant, and look way more expensive than they are. Plus they dry in minutes.</p>

        <h3>2. Rust-Proof Shower Caddy — Best Organizer</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>⭐ Best Organizer</h4>
            <p>Tired of shampoo bottles falling on your toes? A good corner shower caddy with tension pole keeps everything organized and within reach. Look for rust-proof stainless steel that'll last years.</p>

        <h3>3. Turkish Cotton Towel Set — Luxury Feel</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>⭐ Luxury Feel</h4>
            <p>Turkish cotton towels are thicker, more absorbent, and softer than regular cotton. Once you try them, you'll never go back to those thin hotel-style towels. A 6-piece set runs around $30-40.</p>

        <h3>4. Automatic Soap Dispenser — Tech Upgrade</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>⭐ Tech Upgrade</h4>
            <p>Touchless soap dispensers aren't just for fancy restaurants anymore. They're hygienic, look sleek on your counter, and kids actually use them because it feels like magic. Most run on 4 AA batteries for months.</p>

        <h3>5. LED Shower Head — Fun Upgrade</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>⭐ Fun Upgrade</h4>
            <p>These shower heads change color based on water temperature — blue for cold, green for warm, red for hot. No batteries needed (they're water-powered). Great for kids and honestly just cool.</p>

        <h3>6. Bathroom Organizer Shelf — Space Saver</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>⭐ Space Saver</h4>
            <p>Over-the-toilet shelving units are the ultimate space hack for small bathrooms. Three tiers of storage for towels, toiletries, and decor without drilling a single hole.</p>

        <h3>7. Luxury Bath Pillow — Relaxation Must-Have</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>⭐ Relaxation Must-Have</h4>
            <p>If you take baths, you need a bath pillow. Suction cups keep it in place, the waterproof foam supports your neck and shoulders, and suddenly your bathtub feels like a spa.</p>

        <h3>8. Freestanding Toilet Paper Holder — Style Points</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>⭐ Style Points</h4>
            <p>Ditch the ugly wall-mounted holder. A freestanding toilet paper stand with storage for extra rolls looks cleaner and doesn't require any drilling. Perfect for renters.</p>

        <h3>9. Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser — Ambiance Creator</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>⭐ Ambiance Creator</h4>
            <p>A good diffuser transforms your bathroom into a spa. Add lavender for relaxation or eucalyptus for that fresh clean feeling. Look for ones with auto-shutoff and color-changing LED lights.</p>

        <h3>10. Heated Towel Rack — Ultimate Luxury</h3>
        <div class="pick-box">
            <h4>⭐ Ultimate Luxury</h4>
            <p>Warm towels after a shower? Yes please. Wall-mounted heated towel racks use minimal electricity and make every morning feel like a five-star hotel experience. The ultimate bathroom upgrade.</p>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>You don't need a full renovation to transform your bathroom. Start with one or two of these picks and work your way up. The bamboo bath mat and Turkish cotton towels are the best bang-for-your-buck starting points. Happy upgrading!</p>
