        <h2>About Arondell Home</h2>
        
        <p>We're a small, independent review site focused on the products that make your home cleaner and your life simpler. No corporate sponsors. No paid placements. Just honest opinions from people who actually buy and use this stuff.</p>
        
        <h3>What We Cover</h3>
        <p>Water filtration, kitchen essentials, home improvement, and everyday products worth your money. We're especially passionate about water quality — because what you drink matters more than most people realize.</p>
        
        <h3>Our Process</h3>
        <p>We buy products with our own money, test them in real daily use, and tell you what we actually think. If something's great, we'll say so. If it's overpriced garbage, we'll say that too. Our reviews are never influenced by brands or advertisers.</p>
        
        <h3>Arondell Apparel</h3>
        <p>We also run a small <a href="https://arondell.etsy.com" target="_blank">Etsy shop</a> selling graphic hoodies and apparel. Original designs, quality prints, and always something a little different. Check it out if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
